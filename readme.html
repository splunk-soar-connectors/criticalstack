    <strong>Prerequisites:</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>CriticalStack Intel account must be created.</li>
        <li>At least one CriticalStack Intel sensor must be created with at least one intel feed in its collection.</li>
        <li>CriticalStack Intel client must be installed on a host reachable by this Phantom instance via SSH.</li>
        <li>Phantom API key must be generated for use by this app.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <strong>Phantom Custom Lists Created by this app:</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>CriticalStack-LastUpdated</li>
        <li>&lt;prefix&gt;-ADDR - List of IPs from CriticalStack (1 per asset definition)</li>
        <li>&lt;prefix&gt;-DOMAIN - List of domains from CriticalStack (1 per asset definition)</li>
        <li>&lt;prefix&gt;-HASH - List of file hashes from CriticalStack (1 per asset definition)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This will create up to 4 Phantom custom lists for each CriticalStack asset defined. One list will be maintained across all assets, 'CriticalStack-LastUpdated'. The purpose of this list is to keep track of when this app last pulled from a particular CriticalStack sensor. This is necessary to prevent rate-limiting by CriticalStack (max: 1 pull per half hour). The other lists will contain the Domains, IPs, and File Hashes retrieved from CriticalStack, as a local (to Phantom) repository. All Domain, IP, and Hash lists will be prepended with the 'prefix' designated in the asset definition to keep track of from which CriticalStack Phantom asset the lists originated.</p>
    <p>When 'file reputation', 'domain reputation', or 'ip reputation' are run, the app will first check the 'CriticalStack-LastUpdated' list for the 'prefix' defined in the asset definition, to see if it has been longer than half hour since a 'pull' was performed. If there have been longer than 30 minutes in elapsed time, the app will connect to the CriticalStack host, perform the 'pull' and then upload the results to the corresponding Phantom lists. Then, the corresponding Phantom list will be checked to see if the ip/file hash/domain exists.</p>
    <p>The 'prefix' allows for separate Phantom lists to be created for individual CriticalStack sensors. It achieves this by prepending each file hash/domain/ip list with this prefix. This allows for users to create sensors for different purposes if desired.</p>
